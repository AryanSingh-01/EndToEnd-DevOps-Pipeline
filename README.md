# EndToEnd-DevOps-Pipeline

An end-to-end DevOps project demonstrating how a production-style web
application can be built, containerized, automated, and deployed on AWS
using modern DevOps practices.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To design and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline for a web application,
covering:
- Application development
- Containerization
- CI/CD automation
- AWS deployment
- Linux server management
- (Future) Kubernetes orchestration

## 🧱 Project Structure
This repository is structured by responsibility:

- `app/` – Application source code
- `docker/` – Docker and container-related files
- `ci-cd/` – CI/CD pipeline configuration and explanations
- `aws/` – AWS architecture and setup documentation
- `linux/` – Server hardening and OS-level scripts
- `kubernetes/` – Kubernetes manifests (planned)
- `docs/` – Design decisions, issues, and improvements

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- Linux
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- AWS (EC2, ECR)
- Kubernetes (later phase)

## 🚧 Project Status
🔄 In progress – currently setting up structure and documentation.

## 📌 Phases
1. Project structure & documentation
2. Application + Docker setup
3. CI/CD pipeline implementation
4. AWS deployment
5. Kubernetes upgrade (optional)

## 📄 Notes
